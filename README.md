## Core Components

### 1. Homepage

**Technology:** Next.js (App Router) | **Port:** `3000` (dev) / `3001` (fallback)

The public-facing marketing and documentation site for the Alegis platform. It introduces the platform's capabilities, showcases each ML model, and provides onboarding guidance for new users.

**Key responsibilities:**
- Product landing page with feature highlights
- Navigation to the Dashboard and individual ML tools
- Documentation and usage guides

---

### 2. Unified Security Dashboard

**Technology:** React + Vite (frontend) | Node.js + Express (backend)
**Ports:** `5173` (UI) | `5007` (API)

The Dashboard is the operational heart of Alegis — a real-time command center that aggregates all security services into a single interface.

**Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Service Health Monitor** | Live status indicators for all 9 ML services |
| **Embedded Model Interface** | Load any ML tool directly in the dashboard via iframe — no tab switching |
| **Panic / Alert System** | One-click "Alert Security" button for immediate incident escalation |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed before running Alegis:

| Dependency | Minimum Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | v18+ | Homepage, Dashboard frontend, Node-based ML models |
| npm | v9+ | Package management |
| Python | 3.9+ | Flask-based ML models |
| pip | Latest | Python package management |
| PowerShell | 5.1+ (Windows) | Startup automation scripts |

> **Note:** On macOS/Linux, the `.ps1` startup scripts can be run with PowerShell Core (`pwsh`), or you can start each service manually (see [Manual Startup](#manual-startup)).

---

### Installation

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/alegis.git
cd Alegis
```

**2. Install Homepage dependencies**
```bash
cd Homepage
npm install
cd ..
```

**3. Install Dashboard dependencies**
```bash
cd Dashboard/frontend
npm install
cd ../backend
npm install
cd ../..
```

**4. Install ML model dependencies**

For each Node.js-based model (`File_Encryption`, `Fraud_Detection`, `Password_Generator`, `Password_Strength`, `Steganography`):
```bash
cd Models/<model-folder>
npm install
cd ../..
```

For each Python/Flask-based model (`Email_Detection`, `DARK WEB MONITORING`, `File_Integrity`):
```bash
cd Models/<model-folder>
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ../..
```

For DeepGuard (Python/Streamlit):
```bash
cd Models/deepguard
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ../..
```

---

### Running the Ecosystem

#### Option A: Single Command (Recommended)

Run everything (Homepage, Signup, Dashboard UI/API, all Node-based models) with one command from the project root:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will automatically install required sub-project dependencies (Node-based) and start all services. Python-based models require Python and pip installed (see Prerequisites). Ports may auto-fallback if the defaults are busy; watch the terminal for the exact URLs.

#### Option B: Master Startup Script (Windows PowerShell)

Run all 12+ services in one command from the project root:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\start_all.ps1
```

This will start:

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Homepage | http://localhost:3000 |
| Dashboard UI | http://localhost:5173 |
| Dashboard API | http://localhost:5007 |
| All 9 ML Models | (see Port Reference below) |

#### Option C: ML Models Only

To start only the ML services without the Homepage or Dashboard:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\start_ml_models.ps1
```

#### Option D: Manual Startup

Start each service individually in separate terminals:

```bash
# Homepage
cd Homepage && npm run dev

# Dashboard frontend
cd Dashboard/frontend && npm run dev

# Dashboard backend
cd Dashboard/backend && node server.js

# Python ML models (example)
cd Models/Email_Detection && python app.py

# Node.js ML models (example)
cd Models/File_Encryption && npm run dev

# Python/Streamlit ML models (example)
cd Models/deepguard && streamlit run app.py --server.port 3008 --server.address 0.0.0.0
```

---

---

## Configuration & Environment

### OpenAI API Key (Dashboard Chatbot)

The Alegis AI Assistant requires an OpenAI API key to function.

1. Open the Dashboard at http://localhost:5173
2. Navigate to the AI Assistant panel
3. Enter your OpenAI API key when prompted
4. The key is stored in your browser's `localStorage` only — it is never sent to any Alegis server

### CORS & Network Binding

All services are pre-configured to:
- Bind on `0.0.0.0` for LAN accessibility (useful in team/lab environments)
- Allow cross-origin requests from the Dashboard origin

To restrict access to localhost only, update the `host` binding in each service's configuration:
- Node.js: modify `server.js` or `vite.config.js` (`host: 'localhost'`)
- Python Flask: change `app.run(host='0.0.0.0')` to `app.run(host='127.0.0.1')`

---

## Security Considerations

- **Local-only by default:** All services are intended for local or internal network use. Do not expose ports publicly without authentication and TLS.
- **API Keys:** Never hardcode API keys. The OpenAI key is handled via `localStorage` and is scoped to the user's browser session.
- **Credentials:** The Dark Web Monitor hashes all input credentials client-side before lookup. Raw credential data is never logged.
- **Encryption:** The File Encryption tool processes files entirely in the browser. No file content is sent to any backend.
- **Startup scripts:** The `.ps1` scripts use `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` for convenience. Review all scripts before running in production or shared environments.

---

## Contributing

Alegis is built with modularity in mind. Each ML model is a self-contained service and can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.

### Adding a New ML Model

1. Create a new folder under `Models/` (e.g., `Models/My_New_Model/`)
2. Add your service with a `package.json` (Node.js) or `requirements.txt` + `app.py` (Python/Flask)
3. Choose an unused port and document it in the Port Reference table above
4. Register the model in `Dashboard/frontend/src/Dashboard.jsx` to surface it in the UI
5. Add the startup command to `start_ml_models.ps1`
6. Submit a pull request with a description of the model's purpose, inputs, and outputs

### Code Style

- **JavaScript/React:** Follow the existing ESLint config per service
- **Python:** PEP 8 with type hints where appropriate
- **Commits:** Use conventional commits format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.)
